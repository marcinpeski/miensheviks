One of the mostly contested issues of the now completed campaign were the retiree health benefits and specifically, the fact that the most recent agreement with the adminstration leaves them up for arbitration. To explain:

* The current situation is that the retirees receive exactly the same health benefits as the active members of the UTFA. Those benefits include Green Shield [health and dental plan](https://uthrprod.service-now.com/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=4fb6e0bfdbc801945fb27b60399619b4), including travel coverage, etc. As the University of Toronto describes it on its [website](https://uthrprod.service-now.com/esc?id=kb_article&sys_id=610137bb1b0db010a1716460604bcb48): 
> The only change made to health & dental benefits coverage when you retire is that the Health Care Spending Account ends. 

* The retiree health benefits are, not surprisingly, much more costly than those of the actives, and this cost is increasing as the live expectancy is going up much faster than the increase in retirement age. The University would like to separate the benefits for the two groups and negotiate them separately. The UTFA opposes this. 

* The recent [agreement](https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/SBPW-MOS-UofT-01-24-2022.pdf) between the administration and the UTFA leaves the retiree benefits to a binding arbitration, together with a host of other issues. The complete list of proposals is listed in Schedule A (for UTFA) and Schedule B for the administration. 

* The list of association proposals is very long (21 positions) and it includes position 17 on etiree benefits (the ordering of positions is not supposed to be indicative of their importance):
>UTFA’s reaffirms that all benefits improvements equally apply to all retirees as has
historically been the case.  

* The administration proposal is much shorter and it includes
    * freezing the retiree benefits at their current level (making sure that increases in the coverage apply only to actives),
    * restricting the Deluxe Emergency travel provision to 60 days for people, including retirees, not on research or study leave,
    * capping private nursing services to $10,000 a year, which is a small fraction of what some members or their families would need to pay for personal care workers.
    * 10% co-pay on extended health care claims – including drugs - to a maximum of $250

* As far as I know, the UTFA have never agreed to leave the retiree benefits for arbitration. (This is an important context of the campaign messages below). At the same time, the university pressure on retiree benefits is relatively new. 

* To summarize the (likely) argument of the administration:

    * The cost of the benefits is growing due to the demographic trends: life expectancy is increasing much faster than the retirement age (which was not raised in the most recent pension agreement). 
    * The university is not in bussiness of running services for retirees - this was one of the main reasons why the university wanted to dseparate itself from the pension pland during the UPP negotiations. 
    * The university benefits should be focused on the actives in making sure that they are able to do their job comfortably, without worrying, for example, about unexpected healthcare costs. 
    * In particular, the university could do a much better job .   

* The UTFA case could (likely) go like this:

    * Each active will become retiree - retiree benefits are promises of benefits for actives. 

    * Because of the implicit promise that the benefits will remain at the same level, none of the retirees invested in private health or plans with similar protections. Such plans are prohibitevely expensive for older people.   

The outcome of the binding arbitration is uncertain. On one hand, the UTFA President made it very clear during the first presidential forums that UTFA will make it very clear that the retiree benefits are of paramount importance and that UTFA is confident to win this fight. On the other hand, the arbitrator will likely look at other universities and see how they resolve the retiree issues. However, the University of Toronto arrangement is very generous and many other places do not have the same benefits for retirees and actives.  

Below, you can find campaign communication on the retiree issues. As you will see, Renan Levine campaign makes a bunch of factual claims and uses them to criticize Terezia Zoric for allowing the benefits as a subject of arbitration. Terezia Zoric campaign reply promises "to correct some misrepresentations". But, in the end, the letter does not question the factual statements, and, instead, pushes back on the critique of negotiation with the argument    

First from Renan Levine campaign:

>Dear Professor XXXX,
>
>UTFA has long taken great pride that retired members receive the same benefits as active librarians and faculty.   In the latest round of negotiations, the current UTFA leadership came to an agreement with the University Administration on salaries and benefits for 2020-2022, but agreed to go to arbitration for 2022-2023 on our entire compensation package.  According to the documents on the UTFA website, as part of the agreement the Administration has proposed to the arbitrator that any benefit increases will apply only to active members, and not to retirees. If the Administration succeeds, this will devalue your benefits especially as inflation raises the cost of services like physiotherapy or visits to an optometrist. 
>
>Members of former UTFA negotiating teams know that UTFA has avoided allowing such an issue to be given to an arbitrator because of the risk that the arbitrator would side with the Administration.  If that were to happen, it is hard to imagine how UTFA might ever persuade the Administration to go back to the old practice. 
>
>The Administration's filing to the arbitrator also features three other issues of particular interest to retirees that are also now at risk: 
>
>* Restrict the Deluxe Emergency travel provision to 60 days for people, including retirees, not on research or study leave. 
>
>* Cap registered nursing services to $10,000 a year. 
>* Introduce a 10% co-pay on extended health care claims – including drugs - to a maximum of $250.
>
>You can read the Administration’s proposal on the UTFA website (see pages 15-16) here:  https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/SBPW-MOS-UofT-01-24-2022.pdf .  UTFA’s  proposals are on page 10-14.  We are very concerned because the Administration's proposal is focused on retiree benefits. 
>
>An experienced and skillful ​negotiator, as the current UTFA President claims to be, would not and should not have allowed our retiree benefits to be sent to arbitration and thus put at risk in this way.  It has ​long been a pillar  ​of UTFA ​negotiations that we do whatever it takes to ensure that retiree benefits remain the same as active member benefits and this guiding principle has now been put in jeopardy.  As a result and depending upon the outcome of arbitration, it is possible that future benefits won in negotiations with the Administration will not apply to retired members.  UTFA should have refused to settle this round of negotiations until retiree benefits were removed from the table. The current UTFA President’s approach calls into question her strategic acumen and her commitment to a core UTFA principle. 
>
>We urge you to restore good governance and principled leadership to UTFA.  We encourage you to vote for Renan Levine for UTFA President.

And a response from Terezia Zoric campaign:

>Dear Retired UTFA Colleagues,
>
>Whether you have already voted or not, I hope that you will read this message. I want to correct some misrepresentations that have been circulated in this campaign about UTFA’s approach to the protection of retiree benefits in the recent round of salaries, benefits, and workload bargaining. This matters because it is essential that retirees know that they can trust UTFA to defend their interests.
>
>In various communications, the other candidate and his team have asserted that UTFA should never have allowed the issue of equal health care benefits for retirees to go to arbitration. That claim reveals an ongoing inability to understand how the bargaining process works or an unwillingness to be honest about it. It also reflects a characteristic tendency to blame UTFA rather than the Administration for unreasonable decisions made by the Administration. Both things should worry anyone who thinks UTFA needs to stand up effectively for the interests of faculty and librarians, including retirees.
>
>If you already understand how the bargaining process works and why the claims of the other candidate’s team are misguided, you probably do not need to read any further. But if their claims have left you feeling uneasy, please read on.
>
>UTFA’s bargaining framework with the Administration is structured largely by Article 6 in our (antiquated) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). This MOA does NOT allow UTFA to dictate any particular bargaining outcome "or else". If the Administration refuses to move off a position, arbitration is the only viable option to resolve intractable disputes. We do not have the option of going on strike or taking any other sort of job action to defend our interests.
>
>In this last, extended, round of bargaining, one of the main intractable disputes was over the Administration’s demand to reduce the costs of health care benefits for retirees. (Another dispute related to excessive workloads.) As it has always done in the past, UTFA’s bargaining team steadfastly refused to agree to two-tiered health benefits. UTFA’s current leadership has staunchly and unfailingly defended equal benefits for retirees. But the Administration would not agree to withdraw its demand. On the other hand, the Administration did agree to our proposals to improve various benefits for UTFA members, including improvements in mental health, massage, physiotherapy, vision, and dental benefits, all of which apply to retirees. So, the UTFA bargaining team decided to obtain benefits improvements for all while sending the issue of future benefits improvements for retirees (and future workload improvements) to arbitration.
>
>Why did we do that? Well, the basic answer is that as much as it was a top priority for UTFA to protect health benefits for retirees, the top priority for the Administration was to create a two-tiered system. Even the dedicated expert help of a highly respected senior labour mediator (Kevin Burkett) could not resolve this fundamental dispute. Moreover, the benefits improvements that we gained for all are real and important, and we were and are very confident that we will win the fight against lesser retiree benefits in arbitration.
>
>Why are we so confident? Because the Administration’s demand is unreasonable and unnecessary (i.e., there’s no demonstrable need for it—U of T can easily afford to treat its UTFA retirees equally). That is not just wishful thinking on our part. We have received expert legal advice from Goldblatt Partners about our likelihood of success in arbitration which they judge to be very high. For another, we had engaged in a great deal of research and analysis about our position. Among other things, we conducted a careful review of faculty association settlement patterns. Ontario university employers are not winning major concessions such as the one the U of T Administration is proposing. 
>
>What was the alternative? If we had simply refused to bargain improved benefits, then those issues, too, would simply have gone to arbitration, which would not have improved the chances of success with respect to protecting equal retiree benefits but would have created a risk of much weaker benefit improvements overall. The other alternative, presumably, would have been to have offered massive concessions on benefits in general to see if we could thereby persuade the Administration to drop its proposal of reducing retiree benefits. You will notice that this issue of what concessions UTFA should have made to induce the Administration to withdraw its demand regarding retiree benefits is one that the other candidate’s team never discusses. They would like you to believe that they could get the Administration to withdraw this demand just because they ask more politely or wait longer than our team did. But they offer no reason to explain why the Administration would do that. And frankly, that is not how bargaining works.
>
>That is why UTFA did not consider the option of foregoing the negotiated agreements and yielding to an unreasonable demand. Going to arbitration—with the knowledge that arbitration briefs are public documents UTFA can use to rally its membership—is a way of taking a stand and letting the Administration know that we will not be bullied into yielding. UTFA can be effective at the bargaining table only if it is a united organization that takes the interests and concerns of all its members into account. That is the approach that UTFA has consistently taken as an Association.
>
>That is why the UTFA bargaining team voted unanimously to recommend to Council that we approve the first two years of our Agreement and proceed to the only dispute resolution mechanism available to UTFA for the remaining items in year 3. And that is why Council agreed to this approach with only one dissenting vote.
>
>The external indicators support our decision. As a result of the Agreement, UTFA’s leaders have been heralded among faculty association chief negotiators for the gains we achieved on behalf of our members at the bargaining table. For example, we have been invited to speak at OCUFA about our proven strategy and tactics for dealing effectively with an aggressive employer within an unfavourable bargaining context. The UTFA team is knowledgeable and prepared for the arbitration process, and so long as this team remains united and intact, we are confident of success.
