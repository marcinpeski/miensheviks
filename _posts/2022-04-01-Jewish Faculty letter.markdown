Although the issues of Terezia Zoric remarks during a public forum on the School of Law hiring controversy and her subsequent 4-month later [apology](https://www.utfa.org/content/statement-apology) were not central to the presidential campaigns, they definitely appeared and they were important to many voters. A group of Jewish faculty wrote a [letter](https://www.tereziazoric.org/letter-of-support-from-jewish-faculty) (see also below) in the support of Terezia Zoric re-election.

The letter explains Terezia Zoric “entitled powerful Zionist minority” comments as targeted at a small group of Council members of a particular political persuasion, who attempted to have UTFA to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The key quote:

>She said: 
>> I wanted to offer that, as an early leader who defended the folks at the Law School and the principles of academic freedom and collegial governance, there was nothing short of unending harassment and psychological warfare where those of us who were supportive of the principles at stake at the heart of the censure experienced horrible backlash by an entitled powerful Zionist minority that felt that any criticisms of [the] Cromwell [report] or anyone else could be met with accusations of antisemitism.”  
> 
>Anyone familiar with the internal tension within UTFA Council at the time understood that the words “entitled powerful Zionist minority” were not intended to evoke any antisemitic trope. Instead, they referred to a minority of UTFA Council members who were persistently derailing important discussions around pressing UTFA matters. Purporting to speak on behalf of all Jewish UTFA members, they attempted, without success, to have UTFA adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and wanted UTFA to oppose the CAUT censure. 

I have no doubt about the sincerity of the support of the signatories for Terezia Zoric. However, the letter is undermined by a factual problem. Although the attempt to make UTFA support the IHRA definition undoubtedly happen, this attempt was not initiated by the (Jewish or not, Zionist or not) members of the Council. **There was no "mionorty of UTFA Council members" who supported UTFA adopting the IHRA definition.** Terezia Zoric could not refer to this group, as this group has not existed. 

>In the context of the discussion, “minority” was not referring to Jews as a minority group, but rather to a very small group in UTFA Council; “entitled” and “powerful” referred to a sense of arrogance and disrespect for democratic process that Terezia and many other council members felt to be informing the behaviour and tactics of that group. The word “Zionist” was not a synonym for Jewish. On the contrary. Knowing that many Jewish faculty members supported the CAUT censure and opposed the adoption of the IHRA definition, Terezia avoided conflating Judaism or Jewishness with support of the actions of the State of Israel and used the word “Zionist” according to its normal usage – as a description of a political persuasion. 

Further, we read

>As noted, around the same period, UTFA Council was pressured to endorse the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. Many faculty at U of T – Jewish and non-Jewish alike – strongly objected to this definition and its related examples, noting that it has been widely used to suppress academic freedom regarding Palestine. These objections were met, however, with further charges of antisemitism.

There was no charge of antisemitism for anybody who objected to the IHRA defintion. Nobody ever spoke in favor of the definition, nor criticized anybody who spoke against it.  

Perhaps the mistake is a consequence of the fact that none of the 25 signatories was a participant in the two Council meetings where the IHRA was discussed and only one particpated in one of those meetings.  
 
The reference to the defintion becomes even problematic because it played an unfortunate role [in the presidential campaign]({% post_url 2022-04-01-IHRA definition and the presidential campaign %}). 

Some additional details:

* The IHRA issue in the Council was initiated in a letter by Louis Florence, at that moment a retiree (a former UTFA Council member, the former Treasurer, and the former Chief Returning Officer) in Feb 2021 to the President T. Zoric. L. Florence asked the Council to consider advocating for the adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism by the University of Toronto.

* The IHRA definition appears in the Council meetings twice. On Feb 18, T. Zoric described the letter and informed about a planned meeting of three committees to discuss the issue.  

* No member of the Council has ever spoken in the Council in support of the IHRA definition. The only support was expressed in 2 or 3 emails by L. Florence. It is difficult to describe his emails as "arrogance and disrespect for democratic process".

* Many signatories of the letter attended the three-committee meeting. I have attended as well and I have heard their very persuasive case against the definition. However, no supporter of the IHRA definition attened this meeting, nobody has spoke for the definition, nor accused anybody of antisemitism. (There was a discussion whether the meeting was properly advertised, and it seemed like opponents of the definition were mobilized, whereas some members of the Council did not even know that the meeting was to happen, or to be open to all UTFA members, not just the Council members. As a result, Louis Florence wrote an open letter to the Council declaring he won't attend).

* In the subsequent days, multiple Council members, including E. Barbeau, R. Gillis, E. Fillion, A. Zilman, R. Levine wrote to the Council advising to ignore the issue i.e., not to hold any vote. 

* In the end, that’s exactly what happened. The Executive Motion on March 23, 2021 called on UTFA  
>not [to] advocate that U of T adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. 
The Executive Motion was neither approved or rejected - it was tabled with all but one member of the Council voting for tabling it. Terezia Zoric (UTFA President), Jun Nogami (VP SBPW), Renan Levine (future presidential candidate), and almost everybody else voted in the same way. 
L. Florence did not attend this meeting (he was not a Council member). However, he sent an email to the Council supporting the basic idea behind the tabling motion. 

* Nobody, including anybody connected to the future presidential campaign of R. Levine, tried to bring this issue back again.  

* Neither R. Levine and, apart from L. Florence, no other members of his campaign team have ever supported adopting the definition by the UTFA or the university.  

* None of the 15 or so signatories of the Jewish Faculty letter was present during the first of the Council meetings when the IHRA definition appeared. One of them, Connie Guberman, was a Council member both in February and March - but she was absent during the two meetings. Judith Taylor, who became a Council member in March, was present during the second meeting - when the Executive Motion was tabled. My recollection is that J. Taylor voted with the majority to table the motion. 
The letter is not clear on from where the signatories got their information about who belonged to the “entitled powerful Zionist minority”.

I understand that, given that the letter appeared on her campaign website, it is an official position of T. Zoric. Which begs the question - if T. Zoric meant a concrete minority of “entitled powerful Zionist” members of the UTFA Council - who is in this group?

<h4>Jewish Colleagues Support the Re-election of Terezia Zorić for U of T Faculty Association President</h4>


We are Jewish faculty and librarians from various faculties and departments across University of Toronto’s campuses. We care deeply about U of T and our faculty association’s central role in university life and work. We are writing specifically as Jewish faculty and librarians because our views and interests have become key issues of contention in the upcoming UTFA election for president. These views have been misrepresented and invoked to denigrate the incumbent.

We support the re-election of Terezia Zorić to serve as UTFA president. 

In our work with Terezia in UTFA and elsewhere, we know her to be an advocate for justice and equity, health and safety, and academic freedom. She has advocated to protect our health and safety through the challenging years of pandemic life; advanced our collective rights through bargaining in the face of austerity measures; and provided numerous fora for communication and representation to advance an equitable workplace. With her leadership, UTFA fought salary discrimination, winning increases for female faculty and librarians, and leading efforts to identify and rectify race-based and other discriminatory pay gaps.

Yet there is a chorus of malicious attacks on Terezia’s character, accusing her of antisemitism.

As Jews, many of us are the descendants of survivors, we are all painfully familiar with antisemitism both past and present. And let us be perfectly clear: U of T has a shameful history of antisemitism, and as long as racism and antisemitism persist in Canada, Jews at U of T may also encounter it on campus. However, the persistent attacks against the president of UTFA have nothing to do with protecting Jewish rights, or with fighting discrimination and racism, or advancing equity and diversity on our campus. These attacks are rather part of a politically motivated effort to shut down speech, scholarship, and activism in support of Palestinian human rights.


A Phrase and An Apology

Much has been made of a poorly phrased comment about organized obstructionism at UTFA, and Terezia made a heartfelt apology for the poor choice of words. At issue is a comment that Terezia made during the Q and A of a public forum addressing the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) censure of U of T regarding donor interference in the hiring process for a director of the International Human Rights Program at the Faculty of Law. Taken out of context, her comments could indeed seem troubling. But meaning cannot be discerned without context, and in context Terezia’s words meant something very different from what her detractors repeatedly allege. 

Terezia was not a scheduled speaker in that event, nor did she play any role in organizing it. During the Q & A, William Graham, a former longtime president of UTFA, who also served as president of OCUFA and CAUT, expressed his disappointment that UTFA had not voted in favour of the CAUT censure, but abstained. That critique prompted Terezia to request permission to “offer a little clarification about the situation at UTFA”. 

She said: “I wanted to offer that, as an early leader who defended the folks at the Law School and the principles of academic freedom and collegial governance, there was nothing short of unending harassment and psychological warfare where those of us who were supportive of the principles at stake at the heart of the censure experienced horrible backlash by an entitled powerful Zionist minority that felt that any criticisms of [the] Cromwell [report] or anyone else could be met with accusations of antisemitism.”  

Anyone familiar with the internal tension within UTFA Council at the time understood that the words “entitled powerful Zionist minority” were not intended to evoke any antisemitic trope. Instead, they referred to a minority of UTFA Council members who were persistently derailing important discussions around pressing UTFA matters. Purporting to speak on behalf of all Jewish UTFA members, they attempted, without success, to have UTFA adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and wanted UTFA to oppose the CAUT censure. 

In the context of the discussion, “minority” was not referring to Jews as a minority group, but rather to a very small group in UTFA Council; “entitled” and “powerful” referred to a sense of arrogance and disrespect for democratic process that Terezia and many other council members felt to be informing the behaviour and tactics of that group. The word “Zionist” was not a synonym for Jewish. On the contrary. Knowing that many Jewish faculty members supported the CAUT censure and opposed the adoption of the IHRA definition, Terezia avoided conflating Judaism or Jewishness with support of the actions of the State of Israel and used the word “Zionist” according to its normal usage – as a description of a political persuasion. 

Of course, not everyone who heard those words was intimately aware of what was happening within UTFA Council, and some Jewish faculty interpreted these words to be antisemitic and hurtful. Indeed, in light of the responses, Terezia reflected deeply on the language she used and issued a heartfelt apology. As educators, we see this as a welcome indication of learning and transparency. As Jews, we are reminded of the Talmudic saying that “in the place where penitents stand, even the full-fledged righteous do not stand”.

But the accusations have continued, and even intensified. 


Context: Antisemitism and the Palestine Exception

The attacks on Terezia come at a time where there is a wider effort to silence a growing community of faculty, librarians, and students who reject the “Palestine exception” and refuse the implication that recognizing and respecting Palestinian human rights is antisemitic.  

Although UTFA abstained on the issue of the censure, there was unanimous support from every other university and college represented on CAUT. The censure drew charges of ‘antisemitism’ from some quarters, though there was no evidence of their legitimacy. Many Jewish faculty at U of T were actively involved in supporting censure. Jewish faculty and librarians were among the largest groups of supporters, and among the earliest to get involved in defence of the censure. 

As noted, around the same period, UTFA Council was pressured to endorse the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. Many faculty at U of T – Jewish and non-Jewish alike – strongly objected to this definition and its related examples, noting that it has been widely used to suppress academic freedom regarding Palestine. These objections were met, however, with further charges of antisemitism. 

Notably, the U of T Antisemitism Working Group report declined to endorse the IHRA working definition of antisemitism (or other definitions), expressing concerns for academic freedom. Correctly, in our opinion, the report placed antisemitism in the wider context of racism and equity. Support for the censure, opposition to the IHRA definition, and the Working Group report were each and all met with charges of antisemitism. 

As in any group, there is a diversity of opinion within the Jewish community and among Jewish faculty at U of T about Israel/Palestine and for freedom of scholarship on these matters.  

Antisemitism, as anti-Jewish racism, should not be minimized or trivialized. Opportunistic and bad-faith charges of “antisemitism” distract from meaningful conversations and hinder the pressing work of addressing the rise of racism, white supremacy, and antisemitism as evidenced across the continent and around the world. This is a conversation that is just beginning. UTFA members must not be silenced – least of all by our own faculty association, which should be working to ensure maximal space for diversity of opinion and debate. 

We will vote to re-elect Terezia Zorić for UTFA President because she is the best candidate to advance our collective interests across the wide range of issues that concern us as faculty and librarians at University of Toronto.
